AnalogNAS is a Python library designed to empower researchers and practitioners in efficiently exploring and optimizing neural network architectures specifically for in-memory computing scenarios. AnalogNAS is built on top of the IBM Analog Hardware Acceleration Kit that enables efficient hardware-aware training with simulated noise injection on multiple IMC devices. By capitalizing on the advantages of in-memory computing, AnalogNAS opens new avenues for discovering architectures that can fully exploit the capabilities of this emerging computing paradigm.

AnalogNAS offers a comprehensive set of features and functionalities that facilitate the neural architecture search process. From seamlessly exploring a vast space of architectural configurations to fine-tuning models for optimal performance, AnalogNAS provides a versatile framework that accelerates the discovery of efficient and effective neural network architectures for in-memory computing.

.. warning::
    This library is currently in beta and under active development.
    Please be mindful of potential issues and keep an eye for improvements,
    new features and bug fixes in upcoming versions.
